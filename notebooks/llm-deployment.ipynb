    "        \"content\": \"\"\"To create a Shoplite account, users visit the registration page and provide their email address, password, and basic profile information. Email verification is required within 24 hours of registration. Users can choose between buyer accounts (free) or seller accounts (requires business verification). Creating a Shoplite account is a straightforward process designed to get new users shopping quickly while maintaining security standards. Users begin by visiting the registration page at shoplite.com/register, where they'll need to provide their email address, create a secure password, and enter basic profile information including their full name and preferred display name. During registration, users can choose between two account types: Buyer accounts are completely free and provide immediate access to shopping features, while Seller accounts require additional business verification steps. All new accounts must verify their email address within 24 hours of registration by clicking a verification link sent to their provided email. The registration form includes optional fields for phone number, birth date, and marketing preferences. Users can enable two-factor authentication during signup for enhanced security, though this can also be added later through account settings. Shoplite supports social login options through Google, Facebook, and Apple for faster registration. Once email verification is complete, new users receive a welcome package including a $10 discount code for their first purchase, access to the Shoplite mobile app, and a personalized onboarding tour highlighting key platform features. Account creation typically takes less than 5 minutes, and users can immediately begin browsing products, adding items to wishlists, and following their favorite sellers.\"\"\"\n",

Cart contents are preserved for logged-in users across sessions. The Shoplite shopping cart system allows users to collect items from multiple sellers in a single, unified cart experience. Items remain in the cart for 30 days for logged-in users, or until the browser session ends for guest users. The cart automatically saves quantity selections, product variations like size and color, and any applicable promotional codes. During the shopping experience, users can adjust quantities, remove items, or save items to their wishlist directly from the cart page. The cart displays real-time pricing updates, including individual item costs, shipping fees from each seller, applicable taxes, and any discount savings. Shoplite's smart cart feature suggests related products and alerts users to limited-time offers on items in their cart. The checkout process begins with shipping address selection, where users can choose from saved addresses or enter a new one. Payment method selection follows, with options including credit cards, PayPal, Apple Pay, Google Pay, and Shoplite's installment payment plans. Users can split payments across multiple methods if needed. Order review displays a detailed breakdown of items by seller, individual shipping costs, estimated delivery dates, and final totals. Users can apply promotional codes at this stage and select gift wrapping options for individual items. The final step requires confirmation of the order, after which users receive an immediate email confirmation and can track their order status through their account dashboard.\"\"\"\n",

Primary payment options include all major credit cards (Visa, Mastercard, American Express, Discover), debit cards with Visa or Mastercard logos, and digital wallets including PayPal, Apple Pay, Google Pay, and Samsung Pay.

Once an order is placed, customers receive an immediate confirmation email with order number and expected processing timeline. Sellers typically process orders within 1-2 business days, after which tracking information becomes available in the customer's account dashboard. The order tracking system displays real-time updates including order confirmation, seller processing, shipment creation, in-transit status, out for delivery, and final delivery confirmation. Customers receive SMS and email notifications at each major milestone, with the option to customize notification preferences in their account settings. Delivery options vary by seller location and product type, but standard options include economy shipping (5-7 business days), standard shipping (3-5 business days), and expedited shipping (1-2 business days). Same-day delivery is available in major metropolitan areas for qualifying local sellers. International shipping is supported with delivery times ranging from 7-21 business days depending on destination. Special delivery services include signature required, adult signature required for age-restricted items, and delivery to pickup locations such as Amazon Lockers or local post offices. Customers can request delivery instructions, specify safe drop-off locations, and schedule delivery windows for an additional fee in supported areas. If delivery issues occur, Shoplite's resolution team works directly with shipping carriers to locate packages and resolve delivery problems.

Most items can be returned within 30 days of delivery for a full refund, provided they remain in original condition with all packaging, tags, and accessories. The return window extends to 60 days for Shoplite Premium members and during holiday seasons. Return eligibility varies by product category and seller policies. Electronics must be returned in original packaging with all accessories and cannot show signs of use beyond initial inspection. Clothing items must have original tags attached and show no signs of wear, washing, or alterations. Personal care items, food products, and custom-made items are generally non-returnable for health and safety reasons. The return process begins through the customer's account dashboard, where they can initiate return requests, print prepaid return labels, and track return shipment status. Shoplite provides free return shipping for defective items, wrong items shipped, or seller errors. Customer-initiated returns may incur return shipping fees depending on the seller's policy and return reason. Refunds are processed within 3-5 business days of return receipt and inspection. Refunds return to the original payment method for credit card purchases, while PayPal and digital wallet refunds are typically instant. Store credit options are available for customers who prefer immediate purchasing power, often with a 5% bonus credit incentive. Partial refunds may apply for items returned outside the standard return window, items with minor damage, or items missing original packaging.\"\"\"\n",

The search function supports natural language queries, specific product model numbers, and even image-based searches where customers can upload photos to find similar items. Auto-complete suggestions appear as users type, learning from popular searches and personal browsing history. Search results can be refined using comprehensive filtering options organized into logical categories. Price filters allow range selection or preset price brackets, while seller filters enable customers to shop from specific merchants, seller ratings, or geographic locations. Product condition filters distinguish between new, like-new, good, and acceptable condition items from various sellers. Category-specific filters provide detailed refinement options tailored to each product type. Electronics filters include brand, screen size, storage capacity, and technical specifications. Clothing filters cover size, color, material, brand, and style categories. Home goods filters include dimensions, materials, room type, and design styles. Advanced filtering options include customer rating minimums, shipping speed preferences, availability status, and promotional offer types. The \"Prime-eligible\" filter shows items available for expedited shipping, while the \"Same-day delivery\" filter displays locally available products. Eco-friendly filters highlight sustainable products and sellers with environmental certifications.

Only customers who have purchased and received items can leave reviews, ensuring authenticity and reducing fake review manipulation. The review system uses a five-star rating scale with additional detailed criteria for comprehensive evaluation. Customer reviews include overall star ratings plus category-specific ratings for product quality, value for money, shipping speed, and seller communication. Written reviews can include photos and videos to provide visual context for other shoppers. The platform encourages detailed feedback by highlighting helpful reviews and rewarding active reviewers with small account credits. Review authenticity is maintained through multiple verification methods including purchase verification, delivery confirmation, and advanced spam detection algorithms. Suspicious review patterns trigger manual review by Shoplite's content moderation team. Sellers cannot alter or delete customer reviews, though they can respond to feedback professionally to address concerns or provide clarifications. The review aggregation system calculates overall product ratings using weighted averages that consider review recency, reviewer credibility, and verified purchase status. Products with higher review volumes and consistent ratings receive priority in search results. Detailed review breakdowns show the distribution of star ratings and highlight common themes in customer feedback. Review guidelines prohibit personal attacks, inappropriate content, competitor manipulation, and reviews unrelated to the product or selling experience.\"\"\"\n",

Prospective sellers begin by creating a seller account through the seller portal, providing business information including legal business name, tax identification numbers, and primary business address. Individual sellers must provide personal identification, while businesses must submit incorporation documents. The verification process includes identity confirmation through government-issued ID verification, business license validation where applicable, and bank account verification for payment processing. International sellers must provide additional documentation including proof of business registration in their home country and compliance with local tax obligations. Verification typically takes 2-3 business days for domestic sellers and up to 7 business days for international applications. Once approved, sellers access the comprehensive Seller Dashboard for managing their Shoplite presence. The dashboard provides inventory management tools, order processing workflows, customer communication systems, and detailed analytics reporting. Sellers can create product listings with multiple photos, detailed descriptions, pricing strategies, and inventory tracking across multiple fulfillment centers. Seller performance metrics are continuously monitored including order defect rate, late shipment rate, customer service response times, and overall customer satisfaction scores. Maintaining high performance standards is required for continued platform access and affects search result visibility.
