## Document 7: Product Reviews and Ratings

Shoplite's review system promotes transparency and helps customers make informed purchasing decisions through verified customer feedback.

Written reviews can include photos and videos to provide visual context for other shoppers. The platform encourages detailed feedback by highlighting helpful reviews and rewarding active reviewers with small account credits. Review authenticity is maintained through multiple verification methods including purchase verification, delivery confirmation, and advanced spam detection algorithms. Suspicious review patterns trigger manual review by Shoplite's content moderation team. Sellers cannot alter or delete customer reviews, though they can respond to feedback professionally to address concerns or provide clarifications. The review aggregation system calculates overall product ratings using weighted averages that consider review recency, reviewer credibility, and verified purchase status. Products with higher review volumes and consistent ratings receive priority in search results. Detailed review breakdowns show the distribution of star ratings and highlight common themes in customer feedback. Review guidelines prohibit personal attacks, inappropriate content, competitor manipulation, and reviews unrelated to the product or selling experience.
